## 1. Traditional Giving (Giving USA 2025)

Source: [Giving USA 2025 Report](https://givingusa.org/giving-usa-2025-u-s-charitable-giving-grew-to-592-50-billion-in-2024-lifted-by-stock-market-gains/)

### Headline Numbers
- **$592.50 billion** total U.S. charitable giving in 2024
- **+6.3%** growth in current dollars (new all-time high)
- **+3.3%** growth adjusted for inflation

### Where It Comes From
- **Individual giving** = two-thirds of all giving, boosted by rising stock market and personal income
- **Corporate giving** hit its highest level on record (both current and inflation-adjusted dollars)

### Where It Goes (by subsector)
- **Religion**: $146.54B (23% of total, largest single category). Grew 1.9%, but down 1% inflation-adjusted.
- **Education, health, arts/culture/humanities, environment/animals**: all four hit all-time highs even after inflation adjustment
- 4 of 9 nonprofit subsectors set records in 2024

### Key Takeaway for Glimpse
Record amounts flowing in. But Giving USA tracks dollars, not outcomes. There is no "connection to impact" metric. The infrastructure hasn't changed — the report itself is structured the same way it has been for decades.

### Headline Numbers
- **$1 billion+** in crypto donated to nonprofits in 2024
- **Biggest year for crypto giving ever**
- **$2 billion** total crypto donated globally over the 5 years leading up to 2024
  - This means 2024 alone = **half of the entire 5-year total**

### Cryptocurrency Breakdown
- **Bitcoin: 64%** of all known crypto donations in 2024
- Bitcoin had briefly fallen behind Ethereum and USDC in 2023, reclaimed the top spot in 2024

### Timing & Behavior
- **Nearly 1/3 of all crypto donations were made in December** alone (year-end tax optimization)
- Average donation size grew significantly, signaling confidence in crypto's stability

### Donor Profile
- Typically **younger, financially savvy, highly engaged online**
- Attracted to nonprofits that embrace **innovation, transparency, and global impact**
- New wave of **AI-driven investors** entering the crypto philanthropy space

### Growth Trajectory
- The Giving Block on pace to surpass **$300 million** in total platform crypto donations by end of 2025
- More organizations than ever accepting crypto donations
- Supportive political landscape fueling further adoption

### Key Takeaway for Glimpse
Crypto donors are exactly Glimpse's target user: young, tech-forward, values transparency. They're already giving — $1B+ in a single year — but through the same traditional nonprofit rails. Glimpse offers what they actually want: on-chain proof, direct connection, zero overhead.

## 3. The Overhead Problem

### Industry Benchmarks
- CharityWatch rates a charity as "highly efficient" if **75%+ of expenses go to programs** and it costs **$25 or less to raise $100**
- That means even the "best" charities have **~25% overhead** (admin + fundraising)
- Many charities fall well below this threshold

### The Overhead Myth
- Overhead percentage is widely regarded as a **poor measure of actual nonprofit effectiveness**
- It says nothing about whether the donation created real impact
- But it's still the #1 metric donors look at, creating a damaging cycle:
  - Nonprofits under-invest in operations to look "lean"
  - This actually reduces their effectiveness
  - Donors still can't see what their money did

### Key Takeaway for Glimpse
The entire evaluation framework is broken. Donors judge charities on overhead ratios. Charities game overhead ratios. Nobody measures actual human outcomes. Glimpse bypasses this entirely: zero fees, direct to need, documented proof.

## 4. Combined Picture — Why Glimpse Matters

| Metric | Traditional | Crypto | Glimpse |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Total giving (2024) | $592.5B | $1B+ | — |
| Avg overhead | ~25% (best case) | Same rails | 0% (Seeker launch) |
| Donor sees impact | Thank-you letter | Tax receipt | Photos, receipts, on-chain proof |
| Transparency | Annual reports | Varies | Every tx on Solana |
| Connection to recipient | None | None | First name, story, documented |
| Model age | Since 1969 | ~5 years | New |

### The Gap Glimpse Fills
1. **$593B flows into charity yearly** — more than ever — but the system connecting donor to impact hasn't changed in 55+ years
2. **Crypto donors are the ideal early adopter**: young, tech-savvy, transparency-obsessed, already giving at record levels
3. **No one is solving the "connection" problem**: donors give, get a letter, and never see what happened. Glimpse closes that loop with on-chain records, photo proof, and real stories
4. **Zero fees removes the overhead objection entirely** — the #1 thing donors evaluate is the exact thing Glimpse eliminates

### Quotable Stats for Pitch / Demo
- "$593 billion donated in 2024. $1 billion in crypto. Zero connection to impact."
- "Half of all crypto ever donated to charity happened in a single year — 2024."
- "64% of crypto donations are Bitcoin. The donors are young, savvy, and they want proof."
- "Even the best-rated charities spend 25% before your dollar reaches anyone."
- "The nonprofit model hasn't fundamentally changed since 1969."
