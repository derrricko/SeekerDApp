## 1. Conviction Story (Write This First)

This is the emotional core of your pitch. Judges fund founders, not features. Write 2-3 raw, honest sentences for each part. Don't polish — your voice is the point.

### Part 1 — The Moment
*What broke your trust in traditional giving?*

- When did you first realize donations disappear into a black hole?
- Was there a specific person or organization that let you down?
- What did that feel like as someone who genuinely wanted to help?

**Your answer:**

### Part 2 — The Person
*Who is this really about?*

- Tell me about one specific person behind one of the 5 needs. Name, face, story.
- The shower need ($25, BeHeard Movement, Tulsa) — is that a real person you know?
- "She skipped dinner so her kids wouldn't have to" — is that from your community?

**Your answer:**

### Part 3 — The Gap
*What doesn't exist that should?*

- You tried giving through existing channels. What was missing?
- When you gave $100, did you ever find out what happened to it?
- What would have kept you giving a second time? (The "golden donation" — if someone gives twice, retention jumps from 7.2% to 59%)

**Your answer:**

### Part 4 — Why This, Why Now
*The Solana + Seeker moment*

- When did blockchain click as the answer to the transparency problem?
- Why is Glimpse a phone app, not a website? What does holding the Seeker add?
- The Seeker is Solana's bet on mobile crypto. How does Glimpse prove that bet right?

**Your answer:**

_____________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________

### Part 5 — The Stakes
*What happens if Glimpse doesn't exist?*

- What stays broken? Who keeps falling through the cracks?
- $592.5B flows through giving every year. How much of it actually changes a life?
- "The model hasn't changed since 1969." Why is that unacceptable?

**Your answer:**

_____________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________

### Part 6 — The Vision
*What does success look like at scale?*

- 5 needs today. What does 5,000 look like? 50,000?
- Utah and Costa Rica are next. Why those places? What connects them to you?
- What does your daughter see when she opens Glimpse in 5 years?

**Your answer:**

_____________________________________________________________

## 2. Pitch Deck — Slide-by-Slide Guide

Build this in your presentation tool. The stats are exact — copy them directly.

### Slide 1: Title
- **GLIMPSE — Documenting Kindness**
- Solana Mobile giving app built for the Seeker
- Your name, @DerrickWKing

### Slide 2: The Problem
- **Headline:** "Donors give once and disappear."
- **Stats to show:**
  - 73.7% of donors don't come back (FEP Q2 2025)
  - New donor retention: 7.2% (Kindsight/FEP Q1 2024)
  - ~70% of donors give only once
- **One sentence that makes someone lean forward:** *(write yours here)*

### Slide 3: Why It's Broken
- **Headline:** "No feedback. No proof. No connection."
- The #1 reason donors leave: they never see what their money did
- Even the best charities spend ~25% on overhead before a dollar reaches anyone
- Fundraising platforms charge 3-10% on top
- "The model hasn't changed since 1969."

### Slide 4: The Insight
- **Headline:** "The Golden Donation"
- Give once → 13.9% retention
- Give twice → **59% retention**
- Give 7+ times → 86.2% retention
- **The question:** Can you get someone to give a second time?
- **The answer:** Show them what their money did.
- *(Have you seen this in your own giving life? Write that here:)*

### Slide 5: The Solution
- **Headline:** "Direct giving. On-chain proof."
- 0% platform fees — 100% goes to the need
- USDC on Solana — instant settlement
- Every gift documented with photos, receipts, real stories
- Verified on a public, permanent ledger

### Slide 6: How It Works
- **4 steps, make this visual:**
  1. **Choose a need** — Real needs from real people ($25 to $1,000)
  2. **Give** — Full donation transfers directly via USDC. No middlemen.
  3. **Wait for it** — You don't know who you helped until after it lands.
  4. **See the impact** — Photos. Receipts. The real story. Proof it landed.

### Slide 7: The Product
- App screenshots or demo video clip
- Show: Welcome screen, Give tab with need cards, wallet signing, success state
- If you have the demo video recorded, embed a link or QR code

### Slide 8: The Market
- **Stats to show in a table or visual:**
  - U.S. charitable giving (2024): **$592.5B** — Giving USA 2025
  - Individual giving: **$392.5B** (66% of total)
  - Crypto donations (2024): **$1B+** record year — The Giving Block
  - Projected crypto giving (2025): **$2.5B**
  - Charity platform market: **$1.09B** → $2.51B by 2033
  - Generational wealth transfer: **$84.4T** underway
- 95% of crypto owners have made charitable contributions
- **Your beachhead market:** *(define this — young Solana users? church communities? Iowa/Midwest?)*

### Slide 9: Why Solana
- Sub-second transaction finality
- Transaction fees under $0.01
- Stablecoins processed ~$30T in 2024 (more than Visa + Mastercard combined)
- Seeker = mobile-first crypto device = the form factor for giving
- MWA (Mobile Wallet Adapter) = native signing on device

### Slide 10: Traction
- **What exists today:**
  - Escrow program deployed to Solana devnet
  - 5 real needs with on-chain vault PDAs
  - 9 integration tests passing (LiteSVM)
  - Complete React Native mobile app with glassmorphic design system
  - MWA wallet integration (Phantom, Solflare)
  - Zero platform fees — 100% to the need
  - All built by one founder

### Slide 11: Team
- **This is YOUR story.** Use Parts 1-4 of your conviction story.
- Your unfair advantage: you know the people, you know the need, you built the tech
- Based in Muscatine, Iowa. Partners in Tulsa. Expanding to Utah and Costa Rica.
- *(What makes YOU the person to build this? Write that here:)*

### Slide 12: The Ask
- **What you need:** *(pre-seed amount)*
- **What it funds:** *(mainnet launch, partner onboarding, first 50 needs, compliance)*
- **Timeline:** *(when do you go live with real money?)*
- **What success looks like:** *(6-month and 12-month milestones)*

## 3. Demo Video Script (2-3 minutes)

Record on the Seeker if you have it. The device is part of the story.

### [0:00-0:10] Hook
Say: *"73% of donors never give again. Here's why — and what we built to fix it."*

### [0:10-0:25] The Problem
Show a generic donation receipt. Say: *"You gave $100. Where did it go? You'll never know. That's why 70% of donors give once and disappear."*

### [0:25-0:45] Meet Glimpse
Show the app opening. Splash screen → 2-3 onboarding slides (not all of them). Say: *"Meet Glimpse. Direct giving on Solana. Zero fees. Full proof."*

### [0:45-1:30] The Flow (money shot)
Walk through the full giving flow:
1. Show the Give tab with all 5 NeedCards
2. Tap "Groceries for a single mom" — read the description aloud
3. "Give This Gift" → amount selection → "Fund the entire need — $100"
4. Confirm modal → type a note of encouragement
5. "Send Gift" → MWA wallet prompt (show the Seeker signing!)
6. Success celebration — glow animation, amount springs in
7. "View on Solana Explorer" — show the real transaction
8. "View Your Glimpses" — show transaction history

### [1:30-1:50] The Proof Promise
Say: *"Coming soon: photos, receipts, real stories from real people. Every gift documented, every impact visible."*

### [1:50-2:10] Why It Matters
Say your conviction story. 2-3 sentences, your voice. This is where you bring it home.

### [2:10-2:20] Close
Say: *"Glimpse. Documenting kindness. Built on Solana."*

### Recording Tips
- Physical Seeker > emulator (the device is the pitch)
- 60fps screen recording for smooth animations
- Record voiceover separately for clean audio
- Keep cuts tight — no dead air
- SHOW the Solana Explorer transaction (proof it's real)
- Need devnet SOL (free faucet) + devnet USDC for a live tx
- If wallet flow is blocked, record UI up to wallet prompt and voiceover: *"On devnet, this settles in under a second"*

## 4. Checklist

- [ ] Write conviction story (all 6 parts)
- [ ] Build pitch deck (12 slides)
- [ ] Record demo video
- [ ] Review README on GitHub (does it tell the story in 60 seconds?)
- [ ] Practice the pitch out loud (can you tell the conviction story without reading?)

**Priority order:** Conviction story first (feeds into slides 2, 5, 11 and the demo). Then deck. Then video.
